## Sample Indicators

**Indicators** can be derived from a combination of **Foundational Datasets** and **Data Products**. By combining Foundational Datasets and Data Products, teams can, on-demand, develop a large array of indicators to meet their project needs. Indicators can presented side-by-side in an Excel workbook -- a format that is generally accessible to the widest audiences. Because all indicators are based on the same underlying data, they are comparable with each other, across geographies and across time.

Should this project evolve to cover additional analytics, this section woudl include sample indicators have been derived and aggregated at a pre-determined admin level over multiple time periods, to show changing trends in each area over time.
