# Summary

Over the past four decades, Morocco has witnessed a significant increase in drought frequency and intensity[^6][^19]. This North African country, known for its diverse landscapes ranging from coastal plains to mountainous regions and deserts, depends largely on agriculture, which forms the economic backbone of rural areas[^6][^21]. The fluctuation in rainfall patterns, primarily due to climate change, has led to recurring droughts causing substantial agricultural losses and impacting the livelihood of the rural population[^4][^11][^22].

The 1980s started with severe droughts that triggered widespread socio-economic challenges[^6][^23]. Morocco, like many African countries, relies heavily on rain-fed agriculture, making it vulnerable to variations in rainfall[^2][^21]. The droughts in the early 1980s led to a decline in agricultural production, exacerbating rural poverty and food insecurity[^6]. To mitigate these effects, the government initiated several irrigation projects and encouraged the cultivation of drought-resistant crops[^3].

The drought conditions continued into the 1990s, with significant dry spells occurring in 1994 and 1995[^6]. These periods were characterized by lower than average precipitation and higher than average temperatures[^4], leading to a decrease in water availability for both agriculture and domestic use[^17]. As a result, the country faced severe economic stress, further straining its limited resources and contributing to rural-urban migration trends[^7][^20].

In the 2000s, the country experienced its worst drought in decades from 2004 to 2007[^13][^19]. It resulted in a significant decrease in agricultural productivity, which contributed to higher food prices and an increase in rural poverty levels[^12]. In response, the Moroccan government implemented strategies aimed at developing drought-resistant agriculture and improving water management systems[^3].

Despite proactive measures, the 2010s saw a continuation of severe drought conditions, exacerbated by global climate change[^11][^22]. The rainfall in these years was erratic, with long dry periods followed by heavy rainfall causing flash floods[^4][^15]. These extreme weather conditions negatively impacted the agricultural sector, threatening food security and the livelihoods of many Moroccan families[^6][^23].

Earth Observation (EO) and climate-derived products have become crucial tools to monitor and manage drought conditions in Morocco[^1][^9][^19]. Remote sensing technology, using satellite imagery, provides critical data on rainfall, temperature, soil moisture, and vegetation health, which are essential indicators of drought[^8][^14]. This information can be used to track changes in these parameters over time and predict potential drought conditions[^1].

One such application is the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), a key indicator of plant health derived from satellite data[^8]. By monitoring the NDVI, authorities can predict crop yields and prepare for potential food shortages[^9]. Similarly, soil moisture indices derived from satellite data can provide early warnings of drought conditions, allowing for proactive measures to be taken[^1][^20].

EO and climate-derived products can also aid in water resource management[^9][^19]. For example, data on precipitation, evapotranspiration, and groundwater levels can inform the allocation of water resources and the planning of irrigation schedules[^17]. This can help to optimize water usage and reduce the impacts of drought on agricultural productivity[^12][^21].

Moreover, these EO technologies can contribute to long-term climate change mitigation strategies[^11][^19]. By tracking changes in climatic parameters over time, researchers can develop more accurate climate models[^4]. These models can inform government policies and actions aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions and promoting sustainable agricultural practices[^5].

In conclusion, Morocco's struggle with drought over the past four decades has resulted in considerable socio-economic challenges, especially in rural areas dependent on agriculture[^6][^22]. However, the advent of Earth Observation and climate-derived products offers promising solutions[^1]. Through continuous monitoring, prediction, and informed decision-making, these tools can help Morocco better manage its resources, mitigate the impacts of drought, and build a more resilient future[^13][^16][^23].
